Description: Fit joint mean-covariance models for longitudinal data within the
    framework of generalised estimating equations (GEE). The models
    and their components are represented using S4 classes and methods. The core
    computational algorithms are implemented using the 'Armadillo' C++ library
    for numerical linear algebra and 'RcppArmadillo' glue.
